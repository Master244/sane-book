# Philosophy

Rooted in its Mission, the philosophy of the Sane Stack is to optimize software development experience to the maximum and enable the developer to achieve the most with the least effort.

Developers  are all about optimization and perhaps the most important of all is optimizing our flow. In search of the optimal we apply the principles found by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi in his 30 year study described in the book  Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience 

Csíkszentmihályi identifies  the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow:

1. intense and focused concentration on the present moment
2. merging of action and awareness
3. a loss of reflective self-consciousness
4. a sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
5. a distortion of temporal experience, one's subjective experience of time is altered
6. experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding, also referred to as autotelic experience

Those aspects can appear independently of each other, but only in combination do they constitute a so-called flow experience.

To achieve this, the following conditions are necessary:

1. Knowing what to do
2. Knowing how to do it
3. Knowing how well you are doing
4. Knowing where to go
5. High perceived challenges
6. High perceived skills
7. Freedom from distractions

Our software stack and cli are designed to meet these conditions during development experience and achieve  flow. We do this mainly by using the latest and greatest within the Javascript language and embracing the paradigm of ‘convention over configuration’ all the way through the software stack. This gives the developer

- A clear set of tasks (1) and guidelines (2).
- Live reload (sockets to the browser) we are able to automatically immediately restart the software and reload the browser thus gaining instant feedback for your latest changes (3).
- Abundant learning resources - How-to-Sane, this book and our resource library give the developer a place to go for further steps  (4)
- With the mission of being ever modern and powerful, the Sane stack’s way of software development is highly sophisticated and at the crest of web development technology (5), using it requires a high degree of skill (6) by nature.
- A high level of automation of the repetitive mechanical tasks and make the developer free for the creative ones. (7)

All this allows the developer to not only be optimally productive, but also creative and fulfilled. 

This is all a lot harder than it may sound and to actually achieve it, the creators of Sane have learned the valuable lessons from the paradigms of Agile and Lean and embrace continuous integration and rapid delivery which is allowed primarily by 2 factors - using highly testable frameworks, Ember for client and Sails for server,  and using Docker for automatically managing software environments and deployments. 

With its many frameworks, modules and high complexity, it would be easy to over-complicate and over-engineer the software stack, but this would be highly counterproductive and undesirable which is why we use Occam’s Razor ( in software development terms may be more familiar as YAGNI or KISS)  as a guiding principle and avoid adding any unnecessary layers and complications.

Stemming from the Unix philosophy, modularity is a very important aspect of the Sane Stack allows functionality to be broken down in interconnected standalone modules which are thus more maintainable. The very powerful combination of modularity and convention allows the creation of easy to install and use add ons which give the developer the power to use a large code base which doesn’t need much time invested in it.

All this work takes correct teamwork and process. Learning from impressive and successful projects like Ember.js, Sails.js, Hapi.js, io.js and Wordpress,  embrace the paradigm of open source software andwe aim to be highly organized through open governance and are completely transparent in the way we work. We are always engaged in training new adopters and contributors to the project.

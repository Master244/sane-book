# What is the Sane Stack?

**SANE** - an abbreviation for '**S**ails **AN**d **E**mber' or '**S**ails **A**ny database and **E**mber' - is a full web software stack and CLI (command line interface) which lets you rapidly create production-ready web apps using Sails for a web server, Ember for a Single Page Application client and Docker to facilitate continuous integration.

The Sane Stack embraces the design paradigm of ['convention over configuration'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration) on both the client and the server. This allows very rapid development, high degree of automation, consistency between all Sane apps and an eco-system of easy to use add ons.

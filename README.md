# SANE - Mastering Full Stack JS
Gitbook link: http://www.sanestackbook.com/

This is the official book on the [Sane Stack](https://github.com/artificialio/sane) which is being written by the community. It will serve as the main learning material for new users and be used in conjunction with [How to Sane](https://github.com/mgenev/how-to-sane). Together the two will form the 'Sane Canon' with the goal of making it as easy as possible to learn how to use the stack properly even for new developers.
